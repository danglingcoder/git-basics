# Understanding Git

## What is version control?

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

## What is git?

Git is a version control software. It is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.

## Basic Git Commands

A) Setting up your identity:

Configure the author name and email address to be used with your commits.
Note that Git strips some characters (for example trailing periods) from user.name.

```
git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"
git config --global user.email sam@example.com
```
